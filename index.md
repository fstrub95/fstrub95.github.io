## Description
I am a PhD candidate at the University of Lille in the Inria [SequeL team](https://team.inria.fr/sequel/), advised by Prof. [Olivier Pietquin](http://www.lifl.fr/~pietquin/) and [Jérémie Mary](http://www.grappa.univ-lille3.fr/~mary/).
My research project explores how to enable computers to acquire language through multimodal interactions. 
Therefore, I focus my work on goal-oriented visually grounded dialogues. 
I am both developing new neural architectures to fuse vision and language modalities, and I am extending deep reinforcement learning methods to fit the dialogue setting. 
Finally, I am also studying dialogues from a multi-player Markov game perspective to develop new training algorithms.

## Workshops
I put a lot of effort in organizing quality workhsop to federate the communties around research direction. Therefore, I was involved in the organization of the following workshop
 - Visually Grounded Interaction and Language (2018) - [website](https://nips2018vigil.github.io/)
 - European Workshop of Reinforcement Learning (2018) - [website](https://ewrl.wordpress.com/ewrl14-2018/)
 - Visually Grounded Interaction and Language (2017) - [website](https://nips2018vigil.github.io/)
 - International conference of Machine Learning (2015), Local commitee - [website](https://icml.cc/2015/)

## Websites
GuessWhat is a two-player visual dialogue game we developed. We used it as a testbed for Visually Grounding Language Machine Learning algorithms. <br/>

LightingTorch is a website I set up when I first started to use Lua-Torch. Its initial goal was to provide helpful tips on the Lua Torch Framework. <br/>
